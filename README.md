The Sentiment-Based Movie Recommendation System is a web-based project that analyzes the sentiment of user input text (such as movie reviews) and recommends movies accordingly.
It uses JavaScript for handling sentiment logic and IMDB dataset integration for displaying relevant movie suggestions, all within a simple and elegant HTML/CSS frontend.
